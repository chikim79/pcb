Circuit Board Design Discussion

The PCB manufacturing simulation design leverages two primary object-oriented design patterns.
The Factory Pattern is used to encapsulate the creation logic for different board types (TestBoard, SensorBoard, and GatewayBoard)
The Observer Pattern is implemented through the StatisticsCollector, which receives notifications directly from each station about defect detections and station failures.

The abstract Station class defines the common interface for all eight manufacturing stations, while concrete implementations handle their specific operations and defect detection logic.
Each station receives its StatisticsCollector dependency through constructor injection, ensuring proper Observer pattern implementation.
Each PCB type can have unique failure probabilities at defect-detecting stations (Place Components, Optical Inspection, Hand Soldering, and Test).
